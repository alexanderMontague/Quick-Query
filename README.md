# Quick-Query
A census and crime data query engine

Final project for CIS2250 software design at The University of Guelph. This query engine was developed by Alexander Montague, Ahmed Mahmoud, and Josua Prpic. The query engine gives information based on Canadian crime data from the years 1998 to 2015 and Canadian census data from the years 2001, 2006, and 2011. All scripts called and run were created with perl, and graphing was done by R.

Run by downloading and extracting "Quick Query Final.tar", navigate to the directory, perl queryEngine.pl
